Embed Second Life Maps in your blog posts!

== Description ==

SL-Map uses an asynchronous wrapper to the slurl.com API to allow JavaScript to rapidly process all second life links (SLURLs) and append the region image to the link.

This plugin is a proof of concept for how a JSON-only API combined with cross-domain XHR has more wide-ranging applications than the current slurl.com API.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `sl-map` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Blog post before hovering over link (there is no visual indication that the SLURLs have been processed).
2. Blog post after hovering over link, showing that the map has been added.

== ChangeLog ==
